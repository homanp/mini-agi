# mini-agi

My personal autonomous mini-me. A little AI buddy that lives on my computer, chats with me on Telegram, and helps get things done.

## What it does

- Runs shell commands on my machine
- Searches the web when it needs fresh info
- Remembers our conversations across sessions
- Learns my preferences over time

## Setup

1. Clone it
2. `bun install`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your keys
4. `bun run dev`

Then find it on Telegram and start chatting.
