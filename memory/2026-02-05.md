I want you to help me with my polymarket account suggest trades etc. I have around 400 usd I want you to help me grow.

**Assistant**:
Hey homanp! That's an interesting request! 📊

I'd be happy to discuss Polymarket strategies with you, but let me be upfront about a few things:

**What I can help with:**
- Analyzing specific markets you're considering
- Discussing probability assessments and expected value
- Research on events/topics to inform your predictions
- General prediction market strategies (diversification, bankroll management, etc.)
- Identifying potential edges based on news/information

**My limitations:**
- ⚠️ I don't have real-time access to Polymarket's current odds/markets
- 🚫 I'm not a financial advisor - prediction markets carry real risk of loss
- 📉 Past performance doesn't guarantee future results

**To get started, it would help to know:**

1. **What markets are you interested in?** (Politics, crypto, sports, tech, current events?)
2. **What's your risk tolerance?** (Conservative small bets vs. concentrated positions?)
3. **What's your time horizon?** (Quick resolution markets vs. longer-term bets?)

If you share some specific markets you're eyeing or topics you follow closely, I can help you think through the probabilities, look for mispriced opportunities, and discuss the reasoning.
